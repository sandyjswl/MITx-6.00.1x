# Problem 5
# 10/10 points (graded)
# Write a Python function that returns the sum of the pairwise products of listA and listB. You should assume that listA and listB have
# the same length and are two lists of integer numbers. For example, if listA = [1, 2, 3] and listB = [4, 5, 6], the dot product is
# 1*4 + 2*5 + 3*6, meaning your function should return: 32

# Hint: You will need to traverse both lists in parallel.

# This function takes in two lists of numbers and returns a number.

# def dotProduct(listA, listB):
#     '''
#     listA: a list of numbers
#     listB: a list of numbers of the same length as listA
#     '''
#     # Your code here
    
 

# Paste your function here
def dotProduct(listA, listB):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(len(listA)):
        sum += listA[i]*listB[i]
    return sum

# Correct
