For this problem, you will implement a variation of the classic wordgame Hangman. For those of you who are unfamiliar with the rules, you may read all about it here. In this problem, the second player will always be the computer, who will be picking a word at random.

In this problem, you will implement a function, called hangman, that will start up and carry out an interactive Hangman game between a player and the computer. Before we get to this function, we'll first implement a few helper functions to get you going.
